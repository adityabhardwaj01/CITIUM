Currently in my second year of college, I ideated a GPT-powered communication coach to improve communication.
To bring this idea to life, I collaborated with friends, we presented our concept to incubation cells at IIT Delhi, FMS Delhi, SRCC, and St. Stephen's College, receiving guidance and incubation offers.

i felt the need to articulate, expressing my though in clear and cconcise manner. this skill need a lot of beforeghand practise, identifying where you lack and make continuous effort on that.
i went to the reddit, internet searching for solution. watched a lot of youtube videos to work on my skill and this is how i stumbled upon this idea of an app.

unique selling point â€”-
-the current available apps are not effective in improving and helping you with your **pronunciation**, help you with you tone especially we need to teach this data on indian accents.
-current apps offer you with you Script about what you say- help you to use the filler words, your pace and vocab.. very free apps help you with eye contact for that matter.
-we help you with your *pronunciation* and how well you learn accent, using ml and ai to help you with your script, use less filler world , your fill + more on your pronunciation using ai and ml data.
